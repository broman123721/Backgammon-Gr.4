#BACKGAMMON

Backgammon is a two-player game played on a board with twenty-four narrow triangles, known as points.
The goal is to maneuver all your checkers into your home board and subsequently bear them off.
Victory is achieved by being the first player to successfully bear off all their checkers.
This project was a component of my Software Engineering coursework, collaboratively undertaken with my partner.
